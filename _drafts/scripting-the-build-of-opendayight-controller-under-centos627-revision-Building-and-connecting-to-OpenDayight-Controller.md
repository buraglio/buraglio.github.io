<a href="https://twitter.com/blinken_lichten" target="_blank">Jon Langemak</a> has a great write up on <a href="http://www.dasblinkenlichten.com/installing-opendaylight-on-centos/" target="_blank">building the OpenDaylight controller under CentOS</a>. Since I&#8217;ll have to do this a bunch of times, I though tI&#8217;d take what he so generously put online and build a very rudimentary script for deploying ODC under CentOS. The prerequisites are that you already have an account and ssh key at the <a href="https://git.opendaylight.org/" target="_blank">OpenDaylight GIT repo</a>.
