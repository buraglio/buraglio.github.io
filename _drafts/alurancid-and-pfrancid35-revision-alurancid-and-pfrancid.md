I did some minor tweaking to the Alcatel Lucent RANCID scripts and some modifications to make RANCID work under my pfsense environment (originally m0n0rancid code from John Skopis). Since I don&#8217;t really do much dev work and am not interested in maintaing a box do be an SVN server for the public, I threw it up onto google code.  
I&#8217;ll be adding a brief how-to on making RANCID work with pfSense as soon as I get some time. 

The scripts can be found here:
