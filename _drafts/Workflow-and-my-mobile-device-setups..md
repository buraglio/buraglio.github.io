Like many others, I rely heavily on my mobile devices to get my work done.  I&#8217;ve been a user of the iPhone since the original, with a year on a Nexus one android device.  I don&#8217;t have a strong preference and there are no &#8220;religious arguments&#8221; to be had with me on platform.  In fact, I&#8217;d probably choose PamlOS if I had a choice, it&#8217;s simple elegance and stability were a comfort to me&#8230;it just didn&#8217;t make it to modernization. ..but I digress. I&#8217;ve chosen to go the Apple route, my machines are all Apple and so the integration makes sense.  That being said, there are a **huge** amount of apps to choose from on all of the major platforms.  Here are the ones that I find myself using, either for work or pleasure, on a weekly basis.  All of these apps are free and work across iPad and iPhone unless otherwise noted.
