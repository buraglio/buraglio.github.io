Seeing at it&#8217;s a new year and all, I couldn&#8217;t resist doing some data mining on the analytics of this site over the course of the last 12 months. I was once again surprised to see that a firewall post was clearly the most popular.  The <a title="Sonicwall – Old dog learns [some] new tricks" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/sonicwall-old-dog-learns-some-new-tricks/" target="_blank">recent post on the Sonicwall</a> was the clear, overwhelming winner having more than twice the views as it&#8217;s closest rival.

It&#8217;s interesting to see that, especially since most of what I do every day is routing and switching.  However, when this site was originally brought online back in 2008 (as tech.buraglio.com) to house my <a title="Updating SRX IDP signatures" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/updating-srx-idp-signatures/" target="_blank">very</a> <a title="Juniper SRX Cluster" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/08/juniper-srx-cluster/" target="_blank">rough</a> <a title="SRX IPv6 flow based processing" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/09/srx-ipv6-flow-based-processing/" target="_blank">notes</a> <a title="Multicast through Juniper SRX 5800" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/multicast-through-juniper-srx-5800/" target="_blank">on</a> <a title="Enabling IPv6 on Juniper SRX 5800 cluster" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2010/10/enabling-ipv6-on-juniper-srx-5800-cluster/" target="_blank">the</a> <a title="Moving JunOS code between SRX cluster nodes" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/01/moving-junos-code-between-srx-cluster-nodes/" target="_blank">Juniper</a> <a title="Upgrading a new SRX 3600" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2011/02/upgrading-a-new-srx-3600/" target="_blank">SRX</a> platform that I had the pleasure of being a very early adopter of, it was really obvious that folks wanted to see that data.  Those posts, although somewhat old, continue to be pretty popular.

The <a title="Plexxi could be WDM for the rest of us." href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/12/plexxi-could-be-wdm-for-the-rest-of-us/" target="_blank">post on Plexxi</a> and the <a title="SDN across domains in the WAN – a novice look" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2012/11/sdn-across-domains-in-the-wan-a-novice-look/" target="_blank">post on SDN across the WAN</a> are also pretty popular and both are pieces I will likely revisit as time permits.

I&#8217;m working on many, many cool projects this year and I plan to write notes on every one of them.  Hopefully they&#8217;ll be useful to someone.
