I am usually available for evening project based work or event based consultation in the following areas. I am not available for on-call types of work of as I have a full time day job.

Contact me for details. I would be happy to provide a quote or provide a lead for someone who can.

## Routing

  * External traffic optimization and tuning

  * Evaluation of services
  * IPv4 and IPv6 services

**I have been doing BGP and IGP work for over 17 years and have extensive experience in the service provider space as well as large high performance and campus networks.**

## Security auditing

**From hardening early service provider networks to analyzing intrusions as an impartial 3rd party and working with law enforcement.**

## Monitoring and management

  * NetFlow/sFlow implementation
  * SIEM/log management
  * Baseline creation and evaluation

**I am a staunch proponent of good monitoring and useful baselines and have implemented single purpose and turn key monitoring systems for the last 20 years.**

## Writing

  * Technical writing
  * White paper creation and consultation
  * Opinion pieces
  * Technical forecasting

**I am a frequent contributor to several online publications as well as several non-technical blogs.**

## Speaking

  * Guest lecturing
  * Workshop instruction
  * Conference and event sessions

**I have been speaking in front of large and small crowds for as far back as I can remember. From instructing workshops on IPv6 and teaching FBI agents black hat techniques to guest lecturing at R1 universities and doing podcasts, I have done a fair share of public speaking.**
