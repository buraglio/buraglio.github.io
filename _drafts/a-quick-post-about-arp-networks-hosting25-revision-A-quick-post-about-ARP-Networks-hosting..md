I&#8217;ve had a co-located server in one way or another for the last 11 years.  From hosting a bare metal box at the [ISP I worked for for a while](http://www.soltec.net/), to sharing a bare metal box at a [colo provider](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=layered%20tech&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDQQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.layeredtech.com%2F&ei=VTiwTuzyHPGDsgLIy_TCAQ&usg=AFQjCNGHUsG4YWgLSFwAwMC4E6zIIea5FQ&sig2=Xngd4LvUbIBFxPkV-cYvwA) to switching to a [VPS service](http://arpnetworks.com/), I&#8217;ve always had an &#8220;offsite box&#8221;.  
I just wanted to post a quick &#8220;these guys are great&#8221; comment to my current VPS provider, ARP Networks.  Not only do they have native IPv6, they also don&#8217;t oversell their VPS hosts and have unparalleled customer service and reliability.  I&#8217;ve had bad, bad, bad hosting service and I&#8217;ve had mediocre hosting service, and without question, I&#8217;m the happiest with ARP Networks.  
If you&#8217;re in the market for a VPS, check them out.  Great pricing, fantastic customer service and a solid, reliable product make them the cream of the crop in this guys&#8217;s opinion. 

As a data point, I get no benefit from evangelizing their service, I just think it&#8217;s that good.
