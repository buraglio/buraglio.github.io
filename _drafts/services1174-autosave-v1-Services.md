I would be happy to provide a quote or provide a lead for someone who can.

## Routing

**I have been doing BGP and IGP work for over 15 years and have extensive experience in the service provider space as well as large high performance and campus networks.**

## Security auditing

**From hardening early service provider networks to analyzing intrusions as an impartial 3rd party and working with law enforcement.**

## Monitoring and management

  * NetFlow/sFlow implementation
