Roughly a month ago I gave up Facebook.  Let me clarify: I did not delete my account.  I deactivated it.  The difference is important for anyone that is still unsure if they want to take a break but may not want to delete the Facebook world entirely.  It&#8217;s explained in decent detail <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/www/214376678584711" target="_blank">here</a>.
