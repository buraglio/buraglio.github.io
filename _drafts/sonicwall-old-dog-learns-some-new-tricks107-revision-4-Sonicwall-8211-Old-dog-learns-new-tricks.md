~12 years ago I had a drinking buddy that worked with me at the regional ISP.   We had a lot in common, he had been an icon back in the [didjits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Didjits) era of punk rock in Champaign Urbana and we had briefly been in a terrible band together.  He introduced me to a dude that to this day I just knew as &#8220;Ravi Sonicwall&#8221;.  He had apparently been recruited from the U of I, written a lot of the low level pieces of the original sonicwall and retired to enjoy life and buy beers (he actually scolded me at a bar for buying him a beer saying &#8220;when I&#8217;m in town, I buy the beers&#8221;).

I had purchased a few sonicwall boxes after that, having only really used linux, IOS, checkpoint on nokia boxes and *_shudder_* Novell Border manager.  I liked the boxes since they had a GUI and I could hand off day-to-day operations to someone that !=Me.  After a year or so in production, I started to become frustrated with them,  the ones I had lacked a CLI completely and had fallen behind on the things I needed to do with them.   Their cost to feature wasn&#8217;t there for what I needed and the ones I had purchased systematically had hardware failures all within 7 months.  I wrote off sonicwall completely at that point.

Fast forward a decade.

Sonicwall purchased by Dell.

We&#8217;ve heavily invested in the Juniper SRX.

The SRX does what we ask of it.

The SRX has some limits.

While I personally like a CLI to rummage around in, not everyone does.  Palo Alto Networks has an amazing GUI.  Like, the best I&#8217;ve ever seen.  Sonicwall&#8230;&#8230;well, theirs always left me wanting back in the day.  Now&#8230;..wow, a totally different ballgame.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the Soniceall &#8220;Super Massive&#8221; still can&#8217;t compete (in this guys opinion) with a Juniper 5800.  **However, **their transparent mode is a tad better and their web management is an order of magnitude better.  Performance?  I don&#8217;t think anything can
