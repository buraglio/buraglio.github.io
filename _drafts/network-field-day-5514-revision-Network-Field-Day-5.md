Last year [Networking Field Day](http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/) was something that I&#8217;d heard of but wasn&#8217;t really aware of what is really was.  I occasionally looked at Twitter and saw the hash tags but did not know much about how it was set up or what it was about.  In fact, I actually thought it was supposed to be like the HAM radio field day stuff where you go out and build out an emergency network on the fly.  OK, I should have done more homework, admittedly.

Flash forward 6 months.

I&#8217;m working more and more with [Brent Salisbury](http://www.networkstatic.com) on day job stuff and he&#8217;s encouraging me to brush the dust off of my [old blog](http://www.forwardingplane.net) (which became this site) and I&#8217;m working more on [OpenFlow](http://www.openflow.org),  virtualization stuff like KVM, VirtualBox and VMware and bringing up 100G WAN links.  I even had the extremely cool opportunity to do a [Packet Pushers Podcast](http://packetpushers.net/show-131-golf-cart-in-my-fibre-tunnel/).

Many of these things are a direct result of becoming more engaged in the larger community, a networking community I had pretty much carved myself out of back in 2002 when I left the service provider world for R&E.  This self isolation was a bit of an oversight on my part. What I did not realize was that, as someone in R&E, I had a unique perspective on some of the industry products and direction.
