A while ago I got an email asking me to participate in <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/" target="_blank">Network Field Day 7</a>.  I was very happy and humbled to get asked again since I wasn&#8217;t able to attend <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd5/" target="_blank">NFD5</a> or <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd6/" target="_blank">NFD6</a> for various reasons outside of my control (although I did try to <a title="Network Field Day 5 – Participate Remotely" href="http://www.forwardingplane.net/2013/03/network-field-day-5/" target="_blank">participate with NFD5  remotely</a>).   If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the <a href="http://techfieldday.com/" target="_blank">tech field day</a> series, you should spend a little time and learn about the value it brings.  There are archived video feeds of <a href="http://techfieldday.com/timing/past/" target="_blank">previous conferences</a> and <a href="http://techfieldday.com/event/nfd7/" target="_blank">live feed</a> and social media outlets for current field days.

To be included in such an event is an amazing experience in and of itself, but to be included with a technical group like this is pretty humbling.  This NFD includes the likes of [Bob McCouch](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//bob-mccouch/), [Brandon Carroll](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/brandon-carroll/), [Chris Marget](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/chris-marget/), [Edward Henry](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//edward-henry/), [Ethan Banks](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//ethan-banks/), [Greg Ferro](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/rich-brambley/chris-evans/greg-ferro/), [John Herbert](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//john-herbert/),[Josh O&#8217;Brien](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/josh-obrien/), [Matt Oswalt](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/luca-delloca/matt-oswalt/), [Paul Stewart](http://techfieldday.com/delegate//paul-stewart/), and [Teren Bryson](http://techfieldday.com/delegate/luca-delloca/teren-bryson/).  All very competent and forward thinking folks in the networking and IT fields.  If this isn&#8217;t enough to get you interested in the value of this event, let me tell you about the schedule.
