If anyone is interested in the talks I participated in at Joint Techs in Fairbanks, AK, they are now on the internet2 sites. 

[IPv6 feature support](http://events.internet2.edu/2011/jt-uaf/agenda.cfm?go=session&id=10001852&event=1151)

[IPv6 campus panel discussion](http://events.internet2.edu/2011/jt-uaf/agenda.cfm?go=session&id=10001863&event=1151)

They&#8217;re apparently not embeddable, but can be watched from the Joint Techs site.
