Let me preface this post by saying that I am absolutely not an enterprise IT or networking guy, take everything that I write here on out with that as a side dish.  
That said, One of the things I really like about KVM is the ability to easily view the console of a guest system using free, non-windows software like VNC. However, much like everyting in life, there are reasons to do one thing or another. I love VMware as well. It&#8217;s refined, well documented, incredibly feature rich and works phenomenally well. It&#8217;s also an enterprise app and to get a lot of the elegant features you either need a windows machine or the expensive paid version. Or both.  
I generally have neither money to spend on lab stuff or software licenses,
