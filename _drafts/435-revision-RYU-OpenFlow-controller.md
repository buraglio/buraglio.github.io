<a href="http://osrg.github.com/ryu/index.html" target="_blank">Ryu</a>, an openflow controller, was new to me. After doing 5 minutes of reading I knew I needed to get it up in the lab. The thing that caught my eye was that the project page was boasting support for OpenStack. Now, I don;t really have much experience with openstack, but it has a cult like following and it&#8217;s on my short list of stuff to get involved with. This seemed like a great excuse.
