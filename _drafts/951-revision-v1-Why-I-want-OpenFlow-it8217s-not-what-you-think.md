OpenFlow is a game changer, no question about it. With all of the buzz about it, I really don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re seeing past its real value, most are focusing on the data center and potentially not seeing the forest for the trees.  I don&#8217;t really care about the gooey center of the data center. I&#8217;ve built, maintained, consulted on or in some way supported so many HPC data centers in the last 12 years that I find them dull at this point*.
