There has been some recent chatter on the <a href="http://lists.cluenet.de/mailman/listinfo/ipv6-ops" target="_blank">IPv6 Ops mailing list</a> about the feature matrix. Sadly, I&#8217;ve let this sort of wither on the vine for a while in favor of OpenFlow and SDN.  At the end of the day, though, as a whole we actually **need** IPv6 more than SDN and OpenFlow at this moment in time, so I&#8217;m resurrecting it.  It is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkRPccDFxV1kdEVNNEhFbG9UZWJlNVJ4NHJlWGtWV1E&amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

A few additions have been made and there is now a &#8220;last edited&#8221; cell so folks can tell if the data is stale or not.  What we need now is your input.  Do you have experience with something that isn&#8217;t on here?  Send over some details.  We&#8217;ll get it added.  Don&#8217;t be shy.  This is important.
