I’m channeling my inner grumpy old man today. Lets throw this out there: social media can be exhausting. Do not misunderstand me, it’s a great tool for communication, obtaining and disseminating information and standard goofing around. It’s also a serious business for a huge amount of companies. I use it extensively myself and I’ll assume there is a pretty good chance you followed a tweet or other social media link to get here. For a green network engineer looking for a path forward it can be a bit daunting, though. Those my age never had the social media aspect to deal with when we were learning, which I will actually say is a bit of an advantage that we had over today: we were often forced to bulldoze through problems, making mistakes that taught us deeper understandings of the inner working of that given technology.

  There are so many buzzwords that it is very easy for an aspiring network engineer to become completely overwhelmed by simply looking at twitter and following a handful of key players. I’ve been building and maintaining large campus, high performance and service provider networks since the 1990s and even I have been feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer number of “Network Engineer Killer” or “Must know” technologies being thrown around.

  Lets break them down in a simple and concise manner and understand that by the time of this writing I’m positive it will be outdated and there will be some new whiz-bang thing that the marketing machine will be saying is the &#8220;something killer&#8221;. Here are the high level things I see thrown around a lot. For what it’s worth, OpenDayLight has <a href="http://www.opendaylight.org/project/technical-overview">a page</a> with some definitions that is pretty good.

    This is absolutely <u><b>not</b></u> all-encompassing and is likely missing major things, however, the point is really not to be accurate as much as it is to demonstrate that there is a <u><b>monumental</b></u> amount of scope that is in some ways interconnected and in other ways completely autonomous. It is also pretty clear that due to the nature of what “DevOps” is, it has ties into many other things. The real issue is how the DevOps is done, but that is a subject for another post.

    What I am really getting at here is that there is no need to get overwhelmed. You don’t need to know all of this stuff. If you know a little about most of it and a lot about one or two topics, then my opinion is that you’re doing really, really well.
