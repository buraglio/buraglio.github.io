For a long time I ran a blog called [tech.buraglio.com](http://www.forwardingplane.net) that was a self hosted wordpress site. After having kids and getting a bit busier at work, I decided to move everything that I had been hosting (images, scripts, hacks, blogs and DNS) to &#8220;the cloud&#8221;. I managed to do this for everything but my primary DNS resolver, which I had always intended to keep, and one [wordpress blog](http://www.shitenonions.com) that I hosted for someone else.

I moved my image hosting from gallery2 to flickr (backup on picasaweb), secondary DNS to nether.net and afraid.org, scripts, hacks and the like to google code and my blogs to blogger.  Blogger was easy, stable and highly available.  It was also far less flexible
