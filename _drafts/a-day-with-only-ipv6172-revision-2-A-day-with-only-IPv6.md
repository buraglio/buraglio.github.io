IPv6 is coming.  Like SDN, we can&#8217;t ignore it.  Are you ready?  Are you apps ready?  I&#8217;ll wager the answer is no.  Mine aren&#8217;t.  I&#8217;ve been working on IPv6 for about 11 years, from early days of tunnels so full native IPv6 at home and at work.  In teaching the IPv6 workshop for internet2, one of the things that I always suggest is to have a dual stacked host and an IPv6 only host available for testing.  These can be virtual machines or physical host, the important detail is that that need to be something that is deployed and known working. Ideally they&#8217;re a mirror or an analog of a typical workstation and or server on your network.

I&#8217;ve been doing this for some time, but I must admit I&#8217;m a little ashamed that I&#8217;ve never tried to do this for my typical workstation.
