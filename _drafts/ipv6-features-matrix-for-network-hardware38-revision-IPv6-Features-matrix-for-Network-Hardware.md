I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of IPv6 stuff lately, and one of the things I didn&#8217;t find (and kinda just wanted to put one together for my own benefit) is a matrix of features I thought were important to have on the IPv6 side for common network hardware. Below is a work in progress of what I have so far, which will automatically publish changes from [this spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/network-hardware-v6-feature-matrix). Please email me if you&#8217;re interested in adding to this or correcting anything I may be incorrect on. 



This has evolved into something else entirely. I&#8217;ve had a very good response to this very rudimentary start of a feature matrix and have decided that it&#8217;s going to get expanded into whatever it needs to become. I&#8217;ve added the start of a matrix for network security hardware / appliances [here](http://www.forwardingplane.net/bit.ly/ipv6-security-matrix).  
I may eventually break this out into L2 and L3 as well as security appliances.
