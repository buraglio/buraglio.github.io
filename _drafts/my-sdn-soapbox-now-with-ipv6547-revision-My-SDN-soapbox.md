This week there was a lot of buzz about SDN (as usual). There was a thread that I commented on and a fantastic read by Brent Salisbury about being the steamroller and not the road. 

All that is old is new again. I remember when networks were small routing protocols were taboo in many internal environments. RIP (AKA routing by rumor) was about as innovative as we got, OSPF was too complex and was &#8220;software changing the network topology&#8221;. Now it is a standard and one would NEVER consider building a complex, production network without an IGP like ISIS or OSPFv[2/3]. This is simple evolution and progression. The more folks try to resist, the further behind they&#8217;ll be left.  
It&#8217;s not unlike IPv6, it&#8217;s been coming for years. It&#8217;s mostly here. Many boring enterprises are struggling to resist it and hold onto NAT as long as possible, and while this will almost certainly buy them
